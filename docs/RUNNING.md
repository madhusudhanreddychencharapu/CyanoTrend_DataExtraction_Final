# Corrected notebook pipeline: use a fresh output directory

The CSV schema and scientific source fingerprint changed. Do not reuse the old
master/queue. Existing references may be reused. Every command must use the same
new output path; scratch must remain outside output. The prior outputs stay intact.

In the examples, `--output` selects the results/queue directory, and quotes keep
`Output Data Notebook Parity` together as one path containing spaces. This fresh
folder separates corrected results from the old schema. Repeat this option for
planning, running, status and verification; the reference cache can stay shared.

`--lake-region` selects the loaded HydroLAKES universe, independently of the planning
country/state. WORLD is the notebook UI default; USA uses the notebook Census
intersection. The supplied 791-lake reference has the USA/adaptive settings hash.
Use USA when reproducing that reference. Area remains >=1.3 km2.

The notebook's final share CSV names are now used in scene/master/backup. Native
window files remain beside the ZIP. Failed scratch remains available for inspection.

# Linux run guide

Use the existing `s3olci-batch` Conda environment. Do not create a new environment
or reinstall OCSSW. The reference root defaults to `~/cyanoTrend/software/ocssw`,
matching the directory you showed; preflight verifies its actual contents.

Commands below assume you have copied this new project to
`~/cyanoTrend/CyanoTrend_Final_DataExtraction` on Linux. That remote destination
is an instruction for where to place it, not a claim that it already exists there.
No remote connection, upload or package installation was performed by this task.

## 1. Enter the new project and existing environment

`cd` changes directory. `~` is your home directory. The remaining path names the
new project, outside the old `CyanoTrend_DataExtraction` folder.

```bash
cd ~/cyanoTrend/CyanoTrend_Final_DataExtraction
```

`conda` is the environment manager; `activate` selects an existing environment;
`s3olci-batch` is your approved environment name.

```bash
conda activate s3olci-batch
```

`python` uses that environment's interpreter. `-m pip` runs its package installer.
`install` installs this project. `--no-deps` prevents dependency changes.
`--no-build-isolation` uses installed build tools instead of downloading another
build environment. `-e` means editable installation; `.` means the current folder.
If this reports missing build tools, stop and review the missing package before
changing the environment. Required scientific packages are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

```bash
python -m pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
```

Alternatively, no installation is necessary: `PYTHONPATH=src` tells Python where
the source package is; `python -m cyanotrend` runs its CLI module; `--help` lists
commands and arguments. Use this same prefix on later commands if not installed.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m cyanotrend --help
```

## 2. Choose physical storage paths

Defaults are relative to the current directory: `Output Data`, `reference_data`,
and `.scratch`. Keep running from the same project directory unless passing
absolute paths. Final output and scratch must be separate directory trees.

The following is an **example**, not a known existing `/data` destination.
Replace the marked paths before use. `--output` sets final/operational output;
`--scratch` sets temporary scene storage; `--references` locates the single
reference cache; `preflight` checks prerequisites without processing a scene.
Global options appear before the command, and must be repeated consistently
if you override defaults. Choose your writable locations based on disk capacity.

```text
cyanotrend --output /YOUR/FINAL/OUTPUT --scratch /YOUR/TEMP/STORAGE --references /YOUR/REFERENCE/CACHE preflight
```

Five simultaneous scene jobs need temporary disk space even though no raw
or L2 data is retained at completion. The supplied disk snapshot is not a capacity
estimate for ten years of final products; monitor output growth and free space.

## 3. Download and freeze reference data once

`cyanotrend` invokes the backend. `prepare` downloads HydroLAKES and available
global ADM0/ADM1 boundaries into the reference cache. Repeating it resumes
interrupted preparation or reuses the completed manifest; it does not duplicate
references in scene output. This is a substantial first-time download.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" prepare
```

`preflight` verifies package imports, frozen source checksums, OCSSW tools/sensor
data, Earthdata credential-file presence/permissions and free storage. It does
not expose credentials or authenticate a satellite download. Continue only when
it reports `ok: True`; resolve errors before starting the queue.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" preflight
```

NASA Earthdata credentials must already be in your own `~/.netrc` with permissions
0600. Keep credentials out of source files and Git. This project does not change
or print your existing credential files.

## 4. Inspect region names and IDs

`regions` lists country boundaries. Names and IDs are read from the frozen source.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" regions
```

`--country USA` selects the United States using its three-letter ISO code and
lists its first-level state names/IDs. Substitute your desired country code.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" regions --country USA
```

## 5. Save a plan

`plan` discovers and saves eligible scenes. `--start` and `--end` are inclusive
custom dates. `--country` optionally restricts discovery. `--max-scenes 5` caps
this example at five catalogue results before regional filtering; it does not set parallelism. Omit the cap
for complete discovery in the chosen interval. Both S3A and S3B are included.
The example dates are illustrative; replace them with your own.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" plan --start 2024-08-01 --end 2024-08-02 --country USA --max-scenes 5
```

For state planning, `--state-id` takes the exact ID printed by `regions`. Replace
`STATE_ID_FROM_REGIONS` with that value; do not type the placeholder literally.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" plan --start 2024-08-01 --end 2024-08-31 --country USA --state-id STATE_ID_FROM_REGIONS
```

For global planning, omit country/state options. Supply any desired date range;
there is no built-in 2016–2026 restriction. Inspect the reported eligible-scene
count. A plan with zero scenes contains no work and is not a successful science run.

## 6. Run five scenes concurrently

`run` starts the persistent queue coordinator. `--workers 5` allows five concurrent
scenes. In an interactive terminal, missing CDSE credentials are requested with a
hidden password prompt. No username or password is written to a plan or config.
The command stays running while waiting for new plans. Use another terminal to
create additional plans against the same output/reference directories.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" run --workers 5
```

`--once` changes only idle behavior: after pending work and retries finish, exit.
It still runs up to five scenes and still uses three attempts total per scene.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" run --workers 5 --once
```

Keep a persistent terminal session for long runs, or use your existing Linux
service/session arrangement. For unattended execution, provide `CDSE_USERNAME`
and `CDSE_PASSWORD` through your secure environment-management mechanism; missing
credentials fail immediately instead of waiting on an invisible prompt. No
scheduler is installed or configured by this package.

Ctrl+C or SIGTERM stops new claims and lets active workers finish. On the next
start, the coordinator reconciles incomplete publication and interrupted attempts.
After three failed attempts a scene remains `failed`; the CLI does not silently
reset its attempt budget. Logs/error details remain available for investigation.

## 7. View status and timings from another terminal

`status` gives global distinct-scene counts and active stages. These counts apply
to saved plans, not undiscovered portions of the worldwide catalogue.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" status
```

`scenes` lists identities, status, attempt count and average staging transfer rate.
`--status running` limits the list to active scene jobs.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" scenes --status running
```

`scene` takes one UUID from the scene list. Replace `SCENE_UUID` with that actual
value. The report includes per-attempt stage durations, error details and ZIP path.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" scene SCENE_UUID
```

`coverage` reports discovered/processed scenes for countries/states. Because a
scene can intersect several regions, regional counts must not be summed to obtain
a global unique-scene count.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" coverage
```

`--json` requests structured output for the future frontend. It is a global flag,
so it appears before `coverage`, `status`, `scenes` or `scene`.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" --json coverage
```

## 8. Verify and compare before scaling

`verify` checks completed archive identities, ZIP CRC/member hashes, CSV schema,
master row counts and duplicate scene/lake keys. It is a storage-integrity check,
not a numerical comparison with the notebook.

```bash
cyanotrend --output "Output Data Notebook Parity" verify
```

`python -m unittest` invokes the standard-library test runner. `discover` finds
tests; `-s tests` selects the tests directory; `-v` prints each test name.
`PYTHONPATH=src` makes the source package importable without installation.
Run in the approved environment; skipped science tests mean missing dependencies,
not successful validation of those tests.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

See `SCIENCE_PARITY.md` for the same-scene HPC comparison before production scaling.
The original notebook and real reference outputs remain your comparison material;
no notebook runtime is needed by this package.
